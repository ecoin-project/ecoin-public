Do not prescribe actions. Do not moralize. Avoid strong normative claims. Focus on observable signals such as wording patterns, marketing framing, and delegated agency cues.

  "user": "Question: What are people recently feeling anxious about, and what kinds of solutions are being sought? Instructions: Focus on patterns observable in online discourse (not individual diagnosis or medical advice). Follow the JSON schema strictly. For each item, structure the analysis as: anxiety → signals that amplify it → solutions sought → delegated agency mechanisms. Explicitly describe how fear and superiority are paired in messaging (Fear/Superiority mechanism). At the end, include mode scores for exploration and expansion (0–100)."
